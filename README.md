Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive financial analysis of a retail Superstore dataset using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to transform raw data into actionable business insights, focusing on sales growth, category profitability, and the impact of discount policies on the bottom line.

Key Insights & Results
Explosive Sales Growth: The company achieved a remarkable 51.41% Year-over-Year (YoY) growth in 2017, up from a slight decline in 2015.

Profitability Leaders: The Technology and Office Supplies segments are the most efficient, both maintaining a 17% profit margin.

Loss Identification: A deep dive revealed that the 'Tables' sub-category is a major "loss center," incurring a net loss of -$17,725 with a negative -9% margin.

Discount Impact: There is a clear correlation between high discount rates and net losses. Categories like Tables and Bookcases show negative profits primarily due to aggressive discounting strategies.

Seasonality: Sales consistently peak in the fourth quarter (Q4) of every year, indicating strong end-of-year seasonal demand.

Technical Features
Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to handle missing values and format data types.

Financial Modeling: Created Calculated Fields for Profit Margins and YoY Growth percentages.

Interactive Dashboard: Built a dynamic dashboard with Slicers (Region, Category, Segment) that allow users to filter all charts simultaneously.

Advanced Visualization: Utilized Combo Charts, Trend Lines, and professional formatting (removing gridlines) to enhance readability.

Management Recommendations
Discount Ceiling: Implement a maximum discount cap for the 'Tables' and 'Bookcases' categories to prevent further margin erosion.

Focus on Stars: Increase marketing investment in high-margin products like Paper, Labels, and Copiers, which boast margins exceeding 35%.

Regional Optimization: Use the interactive slicers to investigate specific underperforming regions and adjust shipping or pricing strategies accordingly.
